<p>The same as an order for employment, also an order for additional position is possible to be created on basis of the alteration of the labour contract, as well as by creating a new order. A new employee position is created with this event (in addition to existing ones). The following information is indicated for the additional position:</p>
<p><img src="images/20.personel_example9.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>Labour Contract No. – number from the Posted Labour Contract list (if an alteration was posted for this event);</li>
<li>Date From – from which date an additional position is assigned;</li>
<li>Planned Date To – planned due date;</li>
<li>Date To – by which date the employee is assigned an additional position. At the end of the term the previous position is restored;</li>
<li>Position Code – code of the add. position;</li>
<li>Department Code – code of department what is related to the add. position – inserts automatically from the position card;</li>
<li>Department Name;</li>
<li>Loading;</li>
<li>Cycle Calendar – enable if the working time is organized according to the shift;</li>
<li>Calendar Code;</li>
<li>Calendar Name;</li>
<li>Cycle Serial Number.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an alteration of the labour contract was issued before the creating the order, the payroll components will be inserted from labour contract payroll components, which will not be able to correct.
Before the posting of the add. position order, the system checks whether the status of the employee is <em>Active</em> at the date of the orders field <em>Date From</em> or not.</p>
<h3 id="position-close-order">Position close order</h3>
<p>Order for the closing of the position includes the following fields:</p>
<p><img src="images/20.personel_example10.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>Labour Contract No. – number from the Posted Labour Contract list (if an alteration was posted for this event);</li>
<li>Employee Position No. – indicates the position that should be closed;</li>
<li>Date To – till which date the position is active.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before posting the order of the position closing, the system checks if the employee is in status Active, when the position is closed.</p>
<h3 id="cancelling-the-posted-orders">Cancelling the posted orders</h3>
<p>It is possible to cancel the whole order, as well as only a specific line. Order or order line can be cancelled from the posted order, but, when using the personnel order with the Event Type <em>Cancellation</em>, only a separate line can be cancelled.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancelling with the posted order.
Open the list <em>Posted Personnel Order List</em>.
Find the order that should be canceled.
You can cancel the entire order by clicking on <em>Process</em> (1) and <em>Cancel Order</em> (2), or cancel only a specific line by clicking on <em>Line</em> (3) and <em>Cancel</em> (4).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/20.personel_example11.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>If the order is canceled through the posted orders, then the description of the reason the contract has been canceled can not be added to the system, and a document cannot be created. But it is the only way to cancel the entire order.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Cancellation of the Order using the Event Type <em>Cancellation</em>. The cancellation order consists of the following fields:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Order No. to Cancel – a posted order number to be canceled;</li>
<li>Order Line No. to Cancel – indicates which line should be canceled;</li>
<li>Cancellation Reason Descr.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any type of the order on condition that there is no salary list created can be canceled. However, it should be remembered that orders must be canceled successively. It means that if, for example, an employee has been employed with an Employment order, and lately their salary has been changed with the Amount Change order, then to cancel the Employment order, first, the order of the amount change should be cancelled.
The canceled orders do not disappear from the system and they can be viewed in the list of posted orders, as well as in the Employee card's section <em>Employee Payment Entries</em>.</p>
<h1 id="labour-protection">Labour Protection</h1>
<p>Labour Protection solution consists of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health Examination solution;</li>
<li>Solution on Briefings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the framework of the health examination solution, it is possible to define the risks of the work environment and assign them to each employee through a position card. For the convenience of the user, the system generates first health examination entries in the journal, when posting the personnel order of the employment of the new employee. By sending the employee to a health examination, you can print the documents from the system. Afterwards, you can record the results of the doctor's conclusion on the employees' health status. All this information can be stored in the health examination entries for all employees, as well as the next examination dates can be indicated. Health examination status for each employee also can be checked from the employee's card.
The briefing solution works similarly as the health examination solution. It is possible to define the types and the themes for the briefings, as well as to assign the briefings to employees through the position cards. You can automatically generate journal entries, plan briefings and review the history of the briefings already performed, as well as from the Briefing Journal you can print a briefing signature page.</p>
<p>The setup relating to the Labour Protection is described in the chapter <em>Personnel Setup</em>.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-health-examinations">Mandatory health examinations</h2>
<h3 id="default-health-exam-journal-batch">Default Health Exam. Journal Batch</h3>

<p>Journal records can be generated by Employee No, Position Code, Profession Code, Department Code, Risk Factor Code and Risk Factor Type. In the tab <em>Options</em>, the date on which you want to generate the lines needs to be identified.
To find out the next test period for the risk factors, the system checks the health examination records - the date of the previous examination and the employment date of the employee. From this obtained date, using risk factor periodicity, the next examination period is calculated. If this period is before the date that was identified in the journal fill option, then the specific health examination is added to the journal.</p>
<p>In case, the value in the field <em>Next Examination Type</em> is Extra, the system will ignore the periodicity of the risk factor and will focus on the value in the field <em>Next Examination Date</em>. To see the risk factors attached to a specific employee position, open the Health Examination Journal - <em>Process</em> (1) - <em>Risk Factors</em> (2).</p>
<p><img src="images/Autom_Journal_2.png" alt="alt"></p>

<h2 id="document-fields-in-business-central">Document fields in Business Central</h2>
<p>In order to be able to create a template, the fields that are used to enter the variable values in the user defined template are developed in the system.
A list <em>Document Fields</em> includes the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code – field code;</li>
<li>Reference – a list in the system from where the fields are processed;</li>
<li>Description – description of the code;</li>
<li>Use Text Case – check if this field can bend in all text cases;</li>
<li>Text Case Gender – select the gender for bending;</li>
<li>Field Value – the field value, already filled in the document.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-templates">Creating templates</h2>
<h3 id="creating-documents-and-inserting-fields-what-are-not-payroll-components">Creating documents and inserting fields, what are not payroll components</h3>
<p>To create a template:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the empty MS Word document or a sample of a document to use as a template;</li>
<li>At the place where you need the information to fill in out of the system, define the field, for example, insert the field for the full name of the employee:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Place a cursor or select the text that needs to be replaced with the equired field;</li>
<li>Press on the pre-attached button <em>Field</em>;</li>
<li>It will open the following window, where you should choose from the list <em>Field names - DocVariable</em> (1) and, in the field <em>New name</em>, type <em>FULLNAME</em> (2) - the name of the field that will return the full name of the employee:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/23.docum_templ_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>most of the fields can be declined. To do this, write the  first letter of the appropriate declension before the field code:</li>
</ul>
<p>G – Genitive – of who?</p>
<p>D – Dative – to whom?</p>
<p>A – Accusative – whom?</p>
<p>I – Instrumental – with what?</p>
<p>L – Locative – in/at?</p>
<p>V – Vocative - hey!</p>
<p>In an example below, declension in accusative would look like as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/23.docum_templ_4.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>The attached field will be invisible by default in the document; therefore, for the user's convenience for editing the document the function <em>Toggle Field Codes</em> can be used. It can be started with the right click on the mouse by pressing in that place, where inserted field is located:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/23.docum_templ_5.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>The transcript of the following field appears:</p>
<p><img src="images/23.docum_templ_6.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat these steps until all document fields are defined.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>The created document save in the field format <strong>Word Document(*.docx)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="adding-the-payroll-component-field">Adding the payroll component field</h3>
<p>The payroll components are added to the document similar to the other fields described in the previous section. The difference is in the definition of the field.
All document fields of payroll components contain the symbol <em>%1</em>, for example, in labour contract payroll component – salary amount looks like this - <em>LPC_%1_AMOUNT</em>. Symbol <em>%1</em> must be replaced with the relevant document field ID that is defined in the payroll component tables.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Labor contract has been created with the following payroll component, which was automatically assigned to a document field ID:</p>
<p><img src="images/23.docum_templ_7.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Then the definition that should be recorded in MS Word file will be as follows - LPC_101PC1_AMOUNT.</p>
<p>Next, the same activities that are described in the previous section by adding fields are required - other than payroll components.</p>
<h2 id="adding-templates-to-business-central">Adding Templates to Business Central</h2>
<p>When the template is created, it must be added to the system. Then it can be added to different events – when preparing the personnel orders, creating labor contracts, etc.</p>
<p>Open the list <em>Document Templates</em>. Under the section <em>Template</em>, click on the button <em>Import Template</em>.  Choose a document you want to import. When the document is imported, a checkmark is added to the field <em>Template Exists</em>.</p>
