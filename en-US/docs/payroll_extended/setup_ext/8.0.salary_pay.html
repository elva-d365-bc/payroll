<h3 id="transferring-the-overtime-to-another-period">Transferring the overtime to another period</h3>

<li>The transfer overtimes indicates in the <em>Overtime Registrations</em> field <em>Moved Overtime</em> and <em>Moved Overtime From</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Should keep in mind that transferred overtimes with the usage type <em>Pay Out</em> will be added to the Accounting' s month overtimes. We recommend to perform a overtime transfer in the last step (before calculating overtime), when the Accounting tab's data is correct and final.</strong></p>
<p>In case the employee will be deleted from the Accounting table, the transferred overtime will be canceled - <em>Overtime Registration</em> data will be returned to the overtime balance, what was up to the transfer.
In case of cancelling the of overtime transfer, then the <em>Overtime Registration</em> fields Payment Accounting Month and Payment Accounting Year must be left blank.</p>
