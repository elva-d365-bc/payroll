<p>The solution is intended for automatic allocation for additional vacation days (for children).</p>
<p>In case the settings are not filled, the automatic day allocation will not happen.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-the-add-vacation-days">Allocating the Add. vacation days</h2>
<p>The rows in employee card's function <em>Relatives</em> are entered. By entering a new record, system checks if stated relative code coincides with a relative code in <em>Vacation Period Add. Vacation Day Setup</em>. In case the code coincides, the recalculation of additional days is offered.</p>
<p><img src="4.3.vacation_setup_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Also at <em>Relatives</em> register is available field <em>Disabled Person</em>, who influences the number of days allocated for the number of add. vacation days.<br>
In the field <em>Age</em>, the system automatically calculates age to today ( This is the date of the server instead of the work date) guided from the value entered in field <em>Birth date</em>.</p>
<p>The system, based on Relatives' data, allocated additional vacation days. It is assumed that if there was at lease 1 day worked at the limits of the vacation period, then this entitles employee for the additional children days. In case if the conditions affecting the number of additional vacation days changes in a one vacation period (for example, the child has reached a certain age), then system calculates the days at the beginning and at the end of the period and assigns the highest number of days.</p>
<p>Also there is a chance to assign day manually using <em>Vacation Period Journal</em> (LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Vacation Periods</em> - <em>Vacation Period Journal</em>). For such purpose, a new field is created in the journal <em>Additional Day Setup Code</em>. This field should only be completed if additional days for children are adjusted.</p>
<p><img src="4.3.vacation_setup_4.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>There is a possibility to run the recalculation of the number of belonging add. vacation days <img src="count1.png" alt="alt"> from the vacation period register <em>Vacation Periods</em> (LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Vacation Periods</em> - <em>Vacation Periods</em>):</p>
<p><img src="4.3.vacation_setup_5.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Using a standard feature <em>Generate Periods</em> <img src="count2.png" alt="alt">, the system will also assign additional days for children.</p>
<p>When you enter the absence, the system performs the recalculation of the balance. If in the setup <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em> does not have a record with the field <em>Absence Code</em> value that coincides with the field <em>Absence Code</em> in the employee's absence card, then recalculation does not happen.</p>
<p>To ensure the day of non-division of children in proportion, those absences who have in the field <em>Influence on Vacation</em> is equal to <em>Reduce Vacation Period</em> , before calculating of available additional days, a filter is enabled <em>Vacation Add. Days Granting Filter</em> for the tab <em>Vacation Period</em> to empty. As well as will not be checked whether a vacation for children balance remains negative, - respectively, if it will be used then there will be no error notice about the lack of days.</p>
<p><img src="4.3.vacation_setup_6.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Extension of days by period: is supplementary functionality to be able to grant additional vacation days for children or other days. System is checking if now is processed the additional vacation, Then checked or in the table <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em> does have a record with the same value like in field <em>Absence Code</em>. If yes, then filter will be applied <em>Vacation Add. Days Setup Filter</em> for tab <em>Vacation Periods</em>, where is not empty, otherwise, it will be set to empty, To calculate correctly available additional vacation days for children or other. If this will be for children, then the field <em>Additional Day Setup Code</em> will be filled with first value found in table <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em>.</p>
<p>In case if additional vacation will be used for the next periods, then when terminating this employee, system will closes current vacation period and others will be deleted.</p>
