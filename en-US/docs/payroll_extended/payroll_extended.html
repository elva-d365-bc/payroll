<p>To start using Dynamics 365 Business Central Latvian Payroll Advanced, there is no need to choose a specific role center. Functionality will work from any role center. However, we recommend to use <em>LV Payroll</em> Role Center in which all payroll shortcuts are available on the home page and the work with payroll would be more convenient and faster.</p>
<h2 id="applying-configuration-package">Applying Configuration package</h2>
<p>All the basic settings for use of Latvian Payroll Advanced are created by applying the configuration package.</p>
<p>To apply the configuration package, click the button <em>Search</em>. Then type in the search field <em>Configuration packages</em> (1) and select from the list (2).</p>
<p><img src="images/0.conf_pack.png" alt="alt"></p>

<li>Payroll setup</li>
<li>Vacation period setup</li>
<li>Additional vacation day setup</li>
<li>Statistical report setup Work-2</li>
<li>Statistical report setup Work-5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-system-setup">General system setup</h2>
<p>In the <em>Company information</em> settings, the following fields are mandatory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name</li>

<ul>
<li>SWIFT code</li>
<li>IBAN</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Chart of Accounts</em> section, accounts that are essential for the payroll will be loaded with the configuration package. If necessary, these accounts are recommended to be renumbered/ renewed so that the adjustment settings should not be adjusted.</p>
<p>In the <em>Dimensions</em> section, dimensions that will be used for payroll should be entered.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>Settings relevant to salary calculation are included under the section <em>Administration</em> from the LV Payroll Role Center shortcuts, or entering the required settings name in the system search.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.0.setting_up_1.png" alt="alt"></p>

<h2 id="departments">Departments</h2>
<p>In the system, structured information about the departments can be maintained. The maintained information will be both current and historical, because the structural units in the system are not deleted, but closed. Following fields are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code – department code defined by the user;</li>
<li>Description - department name;</li>
<li>Address – address where the department is located;</li>
<li>Date Created – date when the department was created;</li>
<li>Date Closed – date when the department is closed;</li>
<li>Parent Department code – department code to which the department is subject;</li>
<li>Manager Position Code - The corresponding manager position code from the list <em>Positions</em>;</li>
<li>Department Dim. Value Code - Department dimension value code (the dimension that has been defined in <em>Personnel Setup</em> is used) from standard payroll dimension classifier;</li>
<li>Decline Gender - choose <em>Female</em> or <em>Male</em> in order to set the declination of the department in the document templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure the departmental hierarchy, sorting and indent methods are combined. Thus, one department is subordinate to another if it is after the main unit and has one level more indention. Depending on the depth of department indention and the number of departments, a department code shall be drawn up. Departmental indentions are created through function buttons in the <em>Departments</em> tool pane. For example, dividing the code into three parts „00-00-00”, the first part is the higher department level code, second and third respectively are the lower levels. At each level, under the same department, 100 lover departments can be created.</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<p>00-00-00 Management – 1st level</p>
<p>00-10-00 Finance – 2nd level</p>
<p>00-10-10 Accounting – 3rd level</p>
<p>This way, using codes, a method of sorting is provided. In addition, indentions are made according to the level.</p>

<p>The solution is intended for automatic allocation for additional vacation days (for children).</p>
<p>In case the settings are not filled, the automatic day allocation will not happen.</p>
<h3 id="allocating-the-add-vacation-days">Allocating the Add. vacation days</h3>
<p>The rows in employee card's function <em>Relatives</em> are entered. By entering a new record, system checks if stated relative code coincides with a relative code in <em>Vacation Period Add. Vacation Day Setup</em>. In case the code coincides, the recalculation of additional days is offered.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.3.vacation_setup_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Also, in the <em>Relatives</em> register, the field <em>Disabled Person</em> is available that influences the number of days allocated for the number of add. vacation days.<br>
In the field <em>Age</em>, the system automatically calculates age to today (this is the date of the server instead of the work date) guided from the value entered in the field <em>Birth date</em>.</p>
<p>The system, based on Relatives' data, allocates additional vacation days. It is assumed that if there was at least 1 day worked at the limits of the vacation period, this entitles employee for the additional children days. In case if the conditions affecting the number of additional vacation days changes in a one vacation period (for example, the child has reached a certain age), then system calculates the days at the beginning and at the end of the period and assigns the highest number of days.</p>
<p>Also, there is a chance to assign a day manually using <em>Vacation Period Journal</em> (LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Vacation Periods</em> - <em>Vacation Period Journal</em>). For such purpose, a new field is created in the journal <em>Additional Day Setup Code</em>. This field should only be completed if additional days for children are adjusted.</p>

<p>Using a standard feature <em>Generate Periods</em> (3), the system will also assign additional days for children.</p>
<p>When you enter the absence, the system performs the recalculation of the balance. If in the setup <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em> a record with the field <em>Absence Code</em> does not have a value that coincides with the field <em>Absence Code</em> in the employee's absence card, recalculation does not happen.</p>
<p>To ensure the day of non-division of children in proportion, those absences who have in the field <em>Influence on Vacation</em> is equal to <em>Reduce Vacation Period</em> , before calculating of available additional days, a filter is enabled <em>Vacation Add. Days Granting Filter</em> for the tab <em>Vacation Period</em> to empty. As well as it will not be checked whether a vacation for children balance remains negative, - respectively, if it will be used then there will be no error notice about the lack of days.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.3.vacation_setup_6.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Extension of days by period: is a supplementary functionality to be able to grant additional vacation days for children or other days. System is checking if now is processed the additional vacation. Then checking if in the table <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em> there is a record with the same value like in field <em>Absence Code</em> or not . If yes, then filter will be applied <em>Vacation Add. Days Setup Filter</em> for tab <em>Vacation Periods</em>. Otherwise, it will be set to empty, To calculate correctly available additional vacation days for children or other. If this will be for children, then the field <em>Additional Day Setup Code</em> will be filled with first value found in table <em>Vacation Period Add. Day Setup</em>.</p>
<p>In case an additional vacation will be used for the next periods, then when terminating this employee, system will close the current vacation period and others will be deleted.</p>

<h2 id="business-trips">Business Trips</h2>
<p>In order to keep a salary for the employee on a business trip absence, act as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open business trip absence card with reason code <em>KOMAND</em>. Available at LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Absences</em> - <em>Causes of Absence</em>;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In tab Payroll and in the field <em>Calculate in Payroll as</em>  (1) select – <em>Keep Salary Separated</em> (The salary for business trip days will be calculated in another payroll component) or <em>Keep Salary</em> (Then the calculated salary for business trip days will be calculated on the basic salary component);</p>
<p><img src="images/4.5.business_trips_1.png" alt="alt"></p>
</li>
<li><p>If the type of the salary calculation is stated <em>Keep Salary Separated</em>, then in the field <em>Payroll Component Code</em> (2) the payroll component in whch to calculate the salary for business days should be indicated;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the field <em>Include in Actual Worktime</em> (3), a mark should be placed;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the additional salary payroll component card, the Setup tab must be completed;</p>
<p><img src="images/4.5.business_trips_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
</li>
<li><p>In cases where the business trip continues from one month to the next, it is recommended to split the business trip and create two employee absence cards. For example, if the business trip is in the period from 25.02.2020. to 05.03.2020., then split it in two separate absence cards, like it's shown below:</p>
<p><img src="images/4.5.business_trips_3.png" alt="alt">
<img src="images/4.5.business_trips_4.png" alt="alt"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This will ensure correct business trip day calculation in cases when there is a different number of working days in the months of business trip (If the salary is calculated in proportion to the days worked). If the all business trip money is needed to pay together (without waiting the next month's salary) then it is recommended to use a Prepayment (Role Center - <em>+ Prepayment List</em>);</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>Employee business trip absence records will be reflected in the <em>Accounting</em> table with the code that is stated in the field <em>Graph Code</em> (1) at the Cause of Absence Card's tab Payroll.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.5.business_trips_5.png" alt="alt"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="donor-days">Donor Days</h2>
<p>In the Case of Absence with Code <em>NEIER_DND</em> (available at: LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Absences</em> - <em>Causes of Absence</em>), it should be noted that this absence is entitled to 1 additional vacation day, but the type of calculation of this absence is a salary.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.6.donor_days_1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><strong>Should pay attention to: if a function <em>Day Off Saved Salary</em> is enabled. By entering an absence, daily/hourly gain with a note <em>Average Gain Changed</em> will be calculated in the absence card by the system. By performing a salary calculation, the calculation type stated in Cause of Absence will be ignored and the average gain of absence card will be taken into account.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Daily/ hourly calculation: The employee's payroll components are analyzed, if they have a sign of the basic salary. The following types are processed: in proportion to the days worked, in proportion to hours worked, hour, day. In case if an employee card includes the mark  - <em>Average by Hours</em> at tab <em>Payroll</em>,  then the hourly gain are also calculated. The number of hours for salary calculation is taken from Schedule. If the employee has changed the salary during this period, then the average for this period is analyzed and calculated each day.</p>
<p>For each additional vacation day granted, system will create an entry in <em>Vacation Periods</em> register. Vacation Periods – absence <em>Date From</em> period.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.6.donor_days_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p><img src="images/4.6.donor_days_2.1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Donor's day payment should not be included in the average gain. Therefore, the payment component code must be excluded in Base Code <em>ATVALIN</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.6.donor_days_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p><strong>!!! For a Day-Off regards Donor Day is better to create a new cause of absence card that would have the following setup:</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/4.6.donor_days_4.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>In this case, by calculating the balance on a day, the principle “come into effect at once” (not in proportion) will be used for the award / write-off of the additional days.</p>
<h1 id="hour-register">Hour Register</h1>
<p>Hour registry is required if working timetables are not used, but the calculation of the salary should take into account the amount of hours worked.</p>
<p>By entering the number of employees, the amount of days and hours that the particular employee has worked in the stated Year and Month can be manually entered.</p>
<p>The number of hours can be corrected until the salary calculation (salary calculation paid or booked). When the salary is calculated, hourly correction can not be done.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><strong>If you need to correct the number of hours worked after salary is paid or posted, there must be a storno calculation on the same month, where a mistake has been made.</strong></p>
</div>
<h1 id="working-time-accounting">Working time accounting</h1>
<p>Employee working time accounting is realized by creating the working time tables called Schedule and Accounting.</p>
<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>Schedule – planned working time of the employee. It is required for the system to make correct calculations in the case of a sick list A – determining which day employee must pay, on the basis of planned working hours (see chapter Absences), as well as proportion calculation of the worked time, if an employee has not worked a whole month. A Schedule should be generated timely (for example, at the beginning of the month), to be able to correctly enter the sick lists A.</p>
<p>The schedule is created by generating records from the employee's working time calendar.</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<p>A new schedule is made at: LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Schedules</em> – press <em>+ New</em>. The number will be assigned automatically. Next choose a Year and Month, for what work time schedule will be created (automatically filled with current year and month).</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-list-of-employees">Generating a list of employees</h3>
<p>Schedule (employee list) is generated by pressing on <em>Process</em> - <em>Create Lines</em>. Graphics are filled with all those employees meeting the selected filters above  and having hours from calendars.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-generation-with-ms-excel">Schedule generation with MS Excel</h3>
<p>Schedule can be sent to an Excel file and imported back to the system. To do this, the schedule must have a pre-generated list of employees (list can be and may not be filled with data from calendar). Schedule can be exported by using a function <em>Process</em> - <em>Export to Excel</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.1.schedule_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Report's parameters:</p>
<p>Don't Fill Records – if enabled, hours in the table will not be inserted.</p>
<p>When the export of the Schedule is successfully made, data from other files can be copied to the newly created file or information can be added manually. When importing this file back to the system, all information entered will be saved. It should be noted that only fields in which the planned hours indicated are editable .
For importing back the Schedule into the system the function <em>Process</em> - <em>Import from Excel</em> is used. Note that this function should be carried out in the Schedule, which was previously exported to Excel.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.1.schedule_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>In order for the system to import a Schedule, the name of the Excel file must be specified (path till the file) and Sheet name of the Excel file.</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-schedule-before-closing-the-reporting-month">Updating the Schedule before closing the reporting month</h3>
<p>At the end of the reporting month, the Schedule must be updated to include employees hired during the month. Do this by using function <em>Process</em> - <em>Create Lines</em>. As a result, the new employees will be added to the list.</p>
<h2 id="accounting">Accounting</h2>
<p>Accounting is generated at the end of the month when all employees hired within a month and all absences are registered. It can also be done at the beginning of the month, but in this case, at the end of the month, the list should definitely be updated with the employees hired during the month. Data in the Accounting table can be copied from the schedule, filled in manually or the Accounting Export/Import function to/from MS Excel can be used (create a list of employees, export to Excel, and then import back to the system).</p>
<p>Codes what are used for marking working time and absences are stated in Payroll and Causes of absence setups.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<h3 id="creating-new-accounting-table">Creating new Accounting table</h3>
<p>New Accounting tabel can be created: LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Accountings</em> – button <em>+ New</em>. The number will be assigned automatically. Next, you need to set the Year and Month, for which the Accounting table will be created (automatically filled with current year and month).</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-list-of-employees">Creating the list of employees</h3>
<p>The list of employees in the Accounting table is generated with the function: <em>Process</em> (1) - <em>Create Lines</em> (2). As a result, the list of employees appears, according to the filters what was set prior to generation. Filter can be used to group employees in several tables, if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<h3 id="several-ways-to-fill-in-the-table">Several ways to fill in the table</h3>
<p><strong>Data from Schedule</strong></p>
<p>Accounting table can be filled in with planned working time data from the Schedule table. For this purpose, use function <em>Copy from Schedule</em>. In this case, all registered absences will be ignored.
To get correct data on employee's absences, <em>Copy from absence Register</em> function should be used. As a result, data from absence will be collected in the recording table – for the granted vacations, sick leaves, maternity leaves, and other absences.</p>
<p><strong>Hour split by dimensions</strong></p>
<p>In case, for some employees the same day working hours must be split to different dimensions, hours should be opened by clicking on the number of hours in the column <em>Work Hours</em> and then can be split by pressing the buttons <em>Actions</em> (1) and <em>Split Line</em> (2). The system will set up another row to enter hours. Dimensions can be added with button <em>Dimensions</em> (3).</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_3_1.png" alt="alt">
and</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_3.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p><strong>Filling table with MS Excel</strong></p>
<p>The Accounting table has been exported (sent) to an Excel file. To do this, employee list must be created in the Accounting table. But Accounting table may not be filled with data from the absence register prior to the export. However, data from the Absence Register will ease the data entering manually in Excel. Exporting the table takes place using a feature <em>Export to Excel</em>.
When the export of the Accounting was successfully made, then to the newly created file data from other files can be copied or information can be added manually. When importing this file back to the system, all information entered will be saved.</p>
<p><strong>Only fields for hours, holidays and absences can be modified.</strong></p>
<p>Only the same absence codes that are stated in the system can be used; otherwise, the system will not be able to recognize them, when importing the file back to the system. Pay attention that first row includes totals/actual worked hours, including night hours (second row) and overtime (third row). This table also introduces hired new employees within a month. There are free rows at the bottom of the table for these entries.
In case some employees' worked hours need to be split between different dimensions, those hours with different dimensions should be stated in a separate entry.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_5.png" alt="alt"></p>
<h3 id="updating-the-accounting-before-closing-the-reporting-month">Updating the Accounting before closing the reporting month</h3>
<p><strong>Updating the accounting table</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, Accounting table must be updated with new employees that were hired during the month. Use function <em>Create Lines</em> to update. If necessary, refresh data also from the Schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Adding data with MS Excel</strong></p>
<p>If you fill data by using Export to Excel, then during the month it is also possible to add all hired employees manually. There are free rows at the bottom of the table for these entries. If the list of employees in the system and the Excel table coincides(sequence can be different, but employee numbers must be included and must match), then the import of this table back to the program will be successful.</p>
<h3 id="import-from-excel">Import from Excel</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the next month, when data on the current month of the table is entered, perform importing back to the system.
To import Accounting table back to the system, use function <em>Import from Excel</em>. Note that this function should be carried out in the Accounting, which was previously exported to Excel.</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_6.png" alt="alt">
and</p>
<p><img src="images/7.2.count_6.1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p><strong>In case Dimensions are used in the Accounting tables, attention should be paid that first row for the employee should be created from the system (without dimension assigned) and only then the row with dimension should be added.</strong>
<strong>In case if the function <em>Add Rows to Existing Entries</em> is enabled, the system will add new data by not correcting the previous ones.</strong></p>
<h2 id="controls-and-compensation-of-the-holiday-hours">Controls and compensation of the holiday hours</h2>
<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
<p>The system provides control that does not allow you to enter/import more than 24 hours a day.</p>
<h3 id="compensation-of-public-holiday-hours">Compensation of public holiday hours</h3>
<p>In case a public holiday is postponed to another date (for example 18th of November or 4th  of May), then this information should be entered in working time Calendars with type Nonworking and entry in field <em>Compensated hours</em>.</p>
<p>This solution is intended only for payroll components that are calculated based on the hours. For example, component No. 104, where in component card's field <em>Compensated Hour Comp. Code</em> is entered Payroll Component Code No. 105 - for the calculation of the compensated hours. When entering the employee's salary components, enter the payroll component that will be used in the calculation of the compensated hours.</p>
<p>When generating a Schedule, compensated hours will be shown in detailed entries. Hours will be shown also in case an absence or working hours will be registered on that day - then it is possible to remove or correct them manually in the Accounting table. In the Salary list, these hours will be calculated separately.</p>

<li>in the tool pane press the buttons <em>Actions - Generate Additional Vacation Days</em> to create the additional days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry for the additional vacation day can be canceled only with the function <em>Cancel Generated Additional Vacation Days</em> in the <em>Overtime Registration</em>.</strong></p>
<p>After additional day generation, these entries will be automatically created:</p>
<ul>
<li>entry for the use of overtime;</li>
<li>entry for the additional vacation day adding in the indicated vacation period.</li>
</ul>
<p>After adding the additional vacation days, the personnel order for additional absences can be booked.</p>
<h3 id="overtime-compensation-with-the-day-off">Overtime compensation with the day off</h3>
<p>If an employee wants current month overtime to used in the future as a day off, then before the salary is calculated, in the <em>Overtime Register</em> field <em>Usage Type</em> must be changed to <em>Day Off</em>.</p>
<p>Usage Type also can be changed with the function <em>Change Overtime Usage Type</em>. In the functions filter the accounting document no. where the type must be changed must be indicated.</p>
<p><em>Overtime</em> Usage Type* can be corrected directly from the Accounting table by using the button <em>Overtime Registration</em> from the Sched./Account. Line ListPart tab section <em>Employee</em>.</p>
<p>Day Off can be granted via personnel order posting or absence card creating with the code of absence No. <em>VIRS_ATPUT</em> (described in overtime Setup chapter).</p>
<p>After posting the personnel order or registering an absence card, an entry is automatically created on the usage of overtime.</p>
<p>Payment for the day off will be calculated on the salary list, which coincides with the calculation year and month specified in the absence.</p>
<h3 id="transferring-the-overtime-to-another-period">Transferring the overtime to another period</h3>
<p>It is possible to transfer the remaining overtime of one period to another period.
Overtime transfer can be made with <em>Overtime Registrations</em> function <em>Change Overtime Usage Type</em>. In the functions filter, the accounting document no. from which the overtime is transferred must be indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Before the overtime transfer, an Accounting table where the overtime will be transferred must be created.</strong></p>
<p>The result of transferring the overtime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage Type in the period, from where the overtimes were transferred, changed to the type that was indicated in the transfer function window;</li>
<li>Remaining overtime over the period from which overtime was moved is 0;</li>
<li>Overtime balance in the Accounting table will rise accordingly to the transferred overtime amount.</li>
<li>The transfer overtimes are indicated in the <em>Overtime Registrations</em> field <em>Moved Overtime</em> and <em>Moved Overtime From</em>.</li>
</ul>

We recommend to perform the overtime transfer in the last step (before calculating overtime), when the Accounting tab's data is correct and final.</strong></p>
<p>In case the employee will be deleted from the Accounting table, the transferred overtime will be canceled - <em>Overtime Registration</em> data will be returned to the overtime balance, what was up to the transfer.
In case of cancelling the overtime transfer, the <em>Overtime Registration</em> fields Payment Accounting Month and Payment Accounting Year must be left blank.</p>
<h1 id="component-registers">Component Registers</h1>
<p>The component register is intended to be used in cases where the employee has income or deductions that differ from month to month and are determined outside the program. When filling in the Component Register, all the mentioned salary components will be included in the monthly salary calculation indicated in the register title.</p>
<p>Those premiums and deductions, which for a long period of time are included in the monthly salary calculation as constant amounts, are more convenient to be entered in the employee card. By doing this, an employee will automatically be charged the premium or/and the relevant deduction automatically without manual monthly entries.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-component-register">Creating a new component register</h2>
<p>A new registry is created on the home page or in the system search by selecting <em>Component Registers</em> and choosing <em>New</em>.</p>
<p>The number will be assigned to the register automatically. Next, select the Year and Month for which the benefits and deductions will be entered (when opening a new list, the current year and month will be entered automatically by default) .
It is also recommended to fill in the Description field in a free form, choosing the description, which is then easy to understand and which  is easy to find afterwards - for example, by entering the department name or component type name, or a description of the employee group, etc. (1).</p>
<p>The list of employees in the Component Register can be compiled in several variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>by automatically generating with filters as selecting employees and specifying a specific salary component code;</li>
<li>by selecting employees one by one;</li>
<li>with the help of keyboard combinations Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, simply copy the selected data from Excel directly to the lines of component Register;</li>
<li>by preparing the data in Excel using the export and import function in the toolbar by clicking on <em>Process</em> (2) - <em>Import From Excel</em> (3) or <em>Export To Excel</em> (4).</li>
</ul>
<p>If necessary, the generated or imported rows can be adjusted manually by deleting redundant employee or by changing the <em>Payroll Component Code</em> (5) and/or <em>Amount</em> (6). The period is entered automatically - the same as indicated on the card header. If the component relates to another Period (for example, income is adjusted), the value must be changed to the required one.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In the filter tab <em>Employee</em> the necessary employee selection criteria's can be entered. For instance, dimension values that are attached to the employees' card;</p>
</li>
<li><p>To filter only those employees who worked in the selected month (not terminated till the beginning of the month), in the field <em>Termination Date</em> (5) the filter with two apostrophes should be applied (‘ ’). This means that only the employees who have empty Termination field in the Employees card will be selected;</p>

</ul>
<p><img src="images/5.6.average_month_sal_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ul>
<li>Press <em>OK</em> and system will calculate the average gain for the month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly average earnings are calculated according to the requirements of the Labor Law's chapter 75, part 3 (valid from 01.01.2015.). It states that the monthly average gain calculation must be performed by daily average earnings multiplied by month average working days in the last six calendar months (counting the working days in the last six calendar months and dividing this amount with six).
Monthly average working days in the last six calendar months the system is calculating by the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>If in the Employee card's tab Employee Positions is stated the <em>Salary Type</em> - normal or aggregated working time: to calculate the average working day count in the last six month, system uses the calendar code that is stated in the <em>Payroll Setup's</em> tab General, field <em>Default Calendar</em>;</li>
<li>If in Employee card's tab <em>Employee Positions</em> is stated <em>Salary Type</em> - <em>Aggregated working time</em> and Calendar code matches to the code what is stated in the Payroll Setup's field <em>Default Calendar 6DDN</em>: to calculate the average working day count in the last six month, system uses the calendar code that is stated in the <em>Payroll Setup's</em> tab General, field <em>Default Calendar 6DDN</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="advances">Advances</h1>
<p>Advance list can be created for those employees, who have advance payroll component with value in the employee's card. The advances paid will be automatically included in the calculation of the monthly salary and deducted from the amount to be paid.</p>
<p>A new advance header can be created by clicking on shortcut <em>+ Advance List</em> at the LV Payroll Role Center. All advance lists are registered in <em>Advance List</em>.</p>
<p>The number of the list will be assigned automatically. Next choose a Year and Month (automatically filled with current year and month).
Automatic generation of a list of advance starts by clicking on <em>Process</em> (1) - <em>Insert New Lines</em> (2).</p>
<p>After the advance list generation and initial checks, it is recommendable to change the status from <em>Open</em> to <em>Released</em> (3). This ensures calculated data protection against accidental corrections. If necessary, the status can be changed back to <em>Open</em> (4).</p>
<p>If prior to the employee list generation no filters were used, the system will include whole employee list. For those, who don't have advance values, the line will be with zero amount. These employees can be delete from the list by clicking on button <em>Delete lines with zero Pay-Out</em> (5).</p>
<p><img src="images/8.1.advance_1.png" alt="alt"></p>

<p><img src="images/8.1.advance_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<h1 id="prepayments">Prepayments</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepayments are used to pay for vacation leave (i.e. events from absence register), and also for some kind of bonuses (entered through Component Register) that need to be paid prior to salary before the month end. When creating prepayments, taxes are deducted from calculated amounts in the appropriate period. When creating a Salary list, payment done with prepayment lists will be included in deduction field and will reduce the total payout amount.</p>
<p><strong>Before creating a prepayment list, all known data should be entered to <em>Absence Register</em> and <em>Component Register</em>.</strong></p>
<p>If calculation need to be separated by types, the filters in the <em>Filters</em> tab can be used, where criterias can be set to get more precise positions to be paid with prepayment. For example if you will not set any filter, for payout all open entries from absence Register and Component register that relate to the selected employee will be processed.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><strong>If together with the vacation leave you need to pay also salary for the period till the start of vacation, you need to enter also the absence card with the Cause of Absence Code's No. <em>ALGA_PER</em> (salary for the period).</strong></p>
</div>
<p>New prepayment list can be created by clicking on shortcut <em>+ Prepayment List</em> in the Role Center or with a help of the system search. All prepayment lists are compiled in the <em>Prepayment List</em> register.</p>

<h1 id="corrections-of-the-salary">Corrections of the Salary</h1>
<p>This chapter describes a variety of situations when corrections are needed and different solutions are described to make corrections.</p>
<h2 id="correction-lists">Correction lists</h2>
<p>If it is necessary to adjust the calculation in the already booked/ aid salary list, tax amounts, income amounts, payout amounts and others, then the correction functionality must be used. Because the correction can be made only when the previous calculation is canceled. All the created correction lists are compiled in a register <em>Correction Headers</em>.
Correction List setup: previous salary list payment deduction component (usually payroll component No. 734) needs to be set in <em>Payroll Setup</em>'s tab General, field <em>Next period Deduction Component</em>.</p>
<p>We recommend to perform all absence corrections in the current month by correcting the previous salary list!</p>
<p>There are different types of possible corrections:</p>
<ol>
<li>All employees in the Salary List have the same error in the payroll calculation:
<br> 1) on the salary list toolbar click the buttons <em>Actions</em> (1) - <em>Create Correction Document</em> (2); <br>2) a line generation window will pop up, where you can set filters if necessary. <br>3) a correction list in which the whole calculation one to one is reversed will be generated. The list of cancellations must be posted!; <br>4) data correction should be performed and a new salary calculation must be prepared. The amount of the first payroll payments will be included in the next calculation as a deduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>After posting the reversal, in the corrected salary list's tab <em>Lines</em> reversed entries will be marked with <em>Yes</em> (3), that the line has a correction and the corresponding employee codes are highlighted in red (4). By clicking on a link <em>Line Is Corrected</em> (3), a correction list will open in which the whole one-to-one calculation is canceled.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Error in calculation algorithm due to incorrect tax rate, amount of relief, etc.:
<br> 1) correct tax, relief, etc. rates; <br>2) creates a new salary list without reversing or correcting the previous salary list; <br>3) click the button <em>Insert New Lines</em> and enables the function <em>Create correction line, if exist payroll for this month</em> in the payroll lines generation window. If necessary, select the same filters as it was in the payroll to be corrected; <br>4) the system will prepare a list of corrections that need to be posted. The amount of the first salary list payments will be included in the next salary list calculations as a deduction.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/10.1.corrections1_2.png" alt="alt"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Error in calculating salary for one or more employees:
<br> 1) in the <em>Lines</em> tab of the Salary List, select the employee (or several) who needs a correction. <br>2) by clicking on the <em>Line</em> buttons (1) - <em>Create Correction</em> (2) the line is marked as corrected. <br>3) make corrections and prepare a new salary list, where the calculation is made only for the corrected employee (or several).</li>
</ol>

<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p><strong>If the initial salary list was not paid before the corrective list was created (the payment has not been posted), the system will not allow the payments to be exported, because the next payroll will take into account the information about the payments at the time of cancellation. <br>In case the salary calculation has been reversed and a new salary calculation has not been created for this month, all entries for this month are opened for correction: in the component registers, the absence registers and hour registers.</strong></p>
</div>
<h2 id="social-status-code-is-not-changed-to-the-actual-in-the-employee-card">Social status code is not changed to the actual in the employee card</h2>
<p>Replace the social status code in an employee card and correct the tax setup in employee's salary components. Perform recalculation with enabled function <em>Create correction line, if exist payroll for this month</em> for the month where the corrections are necessary.</p>
<h2 id="sick-list-received-late">Sick List received late</h2>
<p><em>Example: calculated and paid salary for 07.2020. A sick list has been received from the employee for the period 27.07.2020 - 05.08.2020.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Option - perform salary calculation correction in the current period 07.2020.
<br>1) in the salary list 07.2020 a correction shall be made for the line of the relevant employee. Post the correction list; <br>2) In <em>Absence Registration</em> register a new sick leave and indicate 07.2020 in calculation date fields; <br>3) prepare a new Salary List for 07.2020 and in the tab <em>Line</em> include only the employee who needs to make the correction. Update <em>Schedule</em> and <em>Accounting</em> tables and/or <em>Hour register</em> if such was used; <br>4) depending on the result, if extra payment must be made, then use function <em>Export to Payment Journal</em>, but if a deduction has to be made, it will be included in the calculation of salary 08.2020.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option - perform salary calculation correction in the next period 08.2020.
<br>1) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter a new sick leave and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <br>2) In Employee absence card click on button <em>Recalculate</em>. In Absence Register list a check mark Recasted appears for this entry. As a result of the recalculation, the system creates a entry in <em>Component Register</em> for the current period (08.2020) with the previous month's salary correction records. <br>3) at the end of the period, calculate the salary for the current month. The income calculation will be included the previous month's adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The button <em>Recalculate</em> should be used in case when working hours were calculated in the correctable version of the calculation. In all other cases you need to use just the option <em>Cancel Absence</em>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="several-sick-leaves-received-late">Several sick leaves received late</h2>
<p><em>Example: calculated and paid salary for 07.2020. Have been received from the employee a sick list A for the period 15.07.2020 - 24.07.2020 and sick list B for the period 25.07.2020 - 03.08.2020. Correction will be performed in next month - 08.2020.</em>
<br>1) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter sick leave for a sick list A and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>2) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter sick leave for a sick list B and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. Recalculate by clicking on the button <em>Recalculate</em>.</p>
<p>When all absences have been entered, click on <em>Recalculate</em> once system collects information about all absences, and it will make a calculation based on all absences in the Component Register. In case a recalculation is made for each absence, the result will be double entries, so the recalculation only needs to be performed once.</p>
<h2 id="employee-gets-ill-during-vacation">Employee gets ill during vacation</h2>
<p><em>Example: Salary calculated and paid for 07.2020. The employee has a vacation starting from 15.07.2020 and to 31.07.2020. The employee got ill during the leave and submitted sick list A for the period 19.07.2020. - 21.07.2020. and sick list B for the period 22.07.2020. - 31.07.2020. The correction will be performed in next month - 08.2020.</em>
<br>1) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter sick leave for a sick list A and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>2) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter sick leave for a sick list B and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>3) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter the vacation 15.07.2020. - 18.07.2020. and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>4) Open the absence card of the initial vacation and cancel it by clicking on the button <em>Cancel Absence.</em>.</p>
<p>As a result of cancellation, the absence code <em>ATVAL</em> will be changed to the code <em>CORRECTION</em>, and system created entries 08.2020 will be added to <em>Component Registers</em> (salary changes (if any), vacation pay paid). This information will be included in the salary calculation of 08.2020.</p>
<h2 id="employee-withdrawn-from-vacation">Employee withdrawn from vacation</h2>
<p><em>Example: The employee has a vacation 15.07.2020 - 31.07.2020. Calculated and paid vacation pay and salary for 07.2020. After that it turns out that the employee has worked during 20.07.2020. - 21.07.2020. Correction will be performed in next month - 08.2020</em>
<br>1) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter the vacation 15.07.2020. - 19.07.2020. and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>2) In <em>Absence Registration</em> enter the vacation 22.07.2020. - 31.07.2020. and indicate 08.2020 in calculation date fields. <strong>Do not recalculate!</strong> <br>3) Open the absence card of the initial vacation and cancel it by clicking the button <em>Cancel Absence</em>. As a result of cancellation, the absence code <em>ATVAL</em> will be changed to the code <em>CORRECTION</em>, and also system created entries 08.2020 will be added to <em>Component Registers</em>; <br>4) If the hours actually worked for the employee was recorded in <em>Accounting</em> table or <em>Hour Registers</em>, then enter the number of additional hours worked.</p>
<p>The result of the recalculation will be included in the 08.2020 salary list, erroneous and posted salary list 07.2020 will be left unchanged. The system with a minus sign will deduct the calculated vacation pay and add the salary for these days (except if working hours are entered via Hour Register). The amounts will be allocated to the periods for which they are calculated.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-absence-start-or-end-date">Changes in Absence start or end date</h2>
<p>If the employee has an calculated absence, but after the calculation of the salary it is discovered that the period of absence was not correct, then it is possible to adjust this in the next period:
<br>1) enter the correct absence, indicating the calculation month in which the correction is made; <br>2) cancel the previously entered absence by clicking the button on the absence card <em>Cancel Absence</em>; <br>3) calculate the current period salary. The differences between the correct and incorrect absence amounts are added to the current salary list with the help of the system-generated <em>Component Register</em> entry.</p>
<h1 id="processing-the-writ-of-execution">Processing the writ of execution</h1>
<p>In case a company receives a writ of execution for an employees, this document must be registered in the system. The writ of execution can be registered in the employee card's <em>Employee Payroll Components</em>.</p>
<p><em>In the specific example, 20% of the base ALIM (salary after tax) has been deducted using salary component No. 740, where the minimum deduction is EUR 250 per month, and EUR 2000 has been deducted for previous periods. No limit to the total amount of the deductions has been set.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Period – The allocation period of the insurance payment amount must be indicated:
<ul>
<li>Month – is indicated if the insurance payment is divided proportionally by month</li>
<li>Day – is indicated if the insurance payment is divided in proportion to the days;</li>
<li>Week – indicated if the insurance payment is divided in proportion to weeks;</li>

<p><strong>Example</strong>
To set the distribution over the years in proportion to days, the following settings must be performed:</p>
<p><img src="images/15.2.insurance1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>To be able to divide the insurance amount over the years, <em>Year</em> should be selected in the field <em>Period</em>. In case of distribution of the amount in the days, then for each year, the amount will be calculated depending on the insurance policy of a given yearly number of days.<br>
Amount for the beginning/end of the period must be defined to set up the calculation period for an employee's salary line in the Salary List.
Attention should be paid if the <em>Year</em> and <em>End</em> is specified, then the insurance policy lines will be recorded with date 31.12.2020. This means that this entry will be processed only in December 2020. If the employee will be terminated by December 2020, the insurance amount in salary lists will not be registered, and the calculation of the taxable amount therefore will not be made. In this case, the salary list should be adjusted manually.</p>

<h2 id="insurance-policy-amount-accounting-in-the-salary-lists">Insurance policy amount accounting in the Salary Lists</h2>
<p>According to completed information in Employee Insurance settings, the amounts are included in the salary calculation.</p>
<p>Performing the salary calculations for periods from January to November, system does not apply taxes for insurance payments and include these entries in non-taxable income.
Performing salary calculations for the last month of the year, the system calculates the insurance payments for the year as a whole, and if insurance payments have occurred in any of the legislative restrictive conditions, the system then distributes the insurance premium into two parts in the salary calculation, and apply taxes and compulsory contributions to the taxable part of the insurance payment.
Insurance payments summary is calculated on current calendar year, and if necessary tax calculation is also calculated in the month when the employee is terminated.</p>

<h1 id="salary-book-import-form-eds">Salary book import form EDS</h1>
<p>In order not to perform manual changes to the employee reliefs every month, import of salary book data is available: LV Payroll Role Center - <em>Tasks</em> - <em>Salary Book Import List</em>.</p>
<p>A new document is created where the following information shall be entered:</p>
<ul>
<li>No. - is entered manually;</li>
<li>Registration No.  – is completed from the file ;</li>
<li>Company Name - is completed from the file;</li>
<li>Type – you can choose between two options:
<ul>
<li>All - imports all information about relief, is entered from the file;</li>
<li>Changed - imports only changes. EDS report's option must be <em>include all changes</em> ( both non-taxable minimum and all other changes). Otherwise the system will give an error message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-Taxable Minimum Comp. Code – should be selected from the list;</li>
<li>From Date – the start of the period, is completed from the file with the option to edit;</li>
<li>From Date In File – filled from the file;</li>
<li>To Date – the end of the period, filled from the file;</li>
<li>Date Created - filled from the file.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>step:  press the button <em>Import</em>, set up the path to the file. It is possible to specify from which date system should process employees' salary components. In case if no conversion of previous months will be made, this date can be left as it is.</li>
<li>step: When importing the data, it must be processed. Start the function <em>Process</em>. After data processing, you can view both - an imported data and the proposed changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The filter can be removed when you open the appropriate column and, if necessary, manual corrections can be made (for example, the amounts of the non-taxable minimum).</p>
<p><strong>The non-taxable minimum amounts can only be corrected in the column <em>Non-taxable Minimum Count</em>. Only after the amount is corrected the button <em>Process</em> should be pressed. If lines were processed before, but not approved, they need to be processed again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In order not to change the non-taxable minimum amount each month (because it is changing on demand by the employee), it is recommended to ask employee to insert a check mark in EDS profile.</strong></p>
<p><strong>System is processing the additional reliefs: First, second and third group disability. For other additional reliefs (Politically Repressed Persons, or Members of the National Resistance Movement) a warning for manual processing is shown. In case the disability is up to a particular date and the employee is entitled to non-taxable minimum by EDS data, the system will check every non-taxable minimum record (if this employee had a disability for at least one day during this period) and according to that, value will remain or will be canceled. Those who receive a disability allowance, are also entitled for non-applicable minimum as well as for additional relief. Those why receive pensions (for disability) are entitled for only additional relief.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In case there is data for the previous period that is entered manually, for example, non-applicable minimum with period 01.08.20 till 31.08.20, but, additionally, there is data that take effect from 01.09.2020, then previously created record will not be processed. If file will include the period for non-applicable minimum from 1.08.20 till 31.12.20, then for August there will be 2 entries for the non-applicable minimum. We recommend that either import data all the time or enter information manually, and leave the record open (without the end date). Then the system will cancel this record and set up the correct one.</strong></p>
<p>All changes can be viewed in the column <em>Change Count</em>. A performed  action is identified for each line - all that has been done after the approval.</p>
<p>Salary books in the list of import changes can be corrected. For example, if employer does not want to import data on dependants, those entries can be sorted out and deleted.
In case if the changes are correct, select the correct lines and press the button <em>Approve</em>. The changes will be made to the employees' payroll components. Following settings in the <em>Social Statuses</em> must be set, if also retired employees need to be processed:</p>
<p><img src="images/16.tax_book1.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>When processing the data with retired employees, the system checks the <em>Social Status Code</em> field in the employee card. In case if code is <em>DP</em> ( related to pensioners), then processing of the non-applicable minimum is similar to ordinary employees. Social rates will be checked in any case.</p>
<p><strong>In case if prior to import, a status code <em>DN</em> is assigned to employee and information on retirement is received, the <em>Date From</em> of on-applicable minimum is the next month's first date. But, in case if <em>DP</em> status is already in the system, non-applicable minimum date is the same as on-applicable minimum date from EDS file.</strong></p>
<h1 id="sick-list-import-from-eds">Sick-list import from EDS</h1>
<p>In order not to register the sick lists each month manually, imports to the system are available.</p>
<p>For the successful import process the following settings are required:
Payroll Role center - <em>Administration</em> - <em>Sick-list Import Setup</em>.
Following fields are available for the setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sick-list Nos;</li>
<li>Sick-list A Absence Code – a cause of absence code for the sick list A from the list <em>Causes of Absences</em>;</li>
<li>Sick-list B Absence Code – a cause of absence code for the sick list B from the list <em>Causes of Absences</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imports of sick lists are made in the Payroll Role center - <em>Tasks</em> - <em>Sick-list Import List</em>.</p>
<p>To start an import, a new document should be created. The system will assign a number automatically. After assigning a number, you can import a file ( press button <em>Import</em>). The system will require the file path where the import file is located.</p>
<p>After the import, user should check the data and , if necessary, edit it (Employee No., Code of Absence). Then press the button <em>Process Lines</em>, and system will warn that all lines will be deleted. As a result, absence cards will be created.</p>
<p>In case a sick list A is registered, also planned working hours have been registered. After the import the schedule should be adjusted during the sick leave period to employees who have a sick list A.</p>
